üîó What‚Äôs Already Built
‚úÖ gRPC based MCP server for scraping and serving TFE release data
‚úÖ LLaMA-based local integration for summarization with API endpoint/ask-llama  
‚úÖ gRPC client which can present the data returned from gRPC server 
‚úÖ Protobuf-defined data model (MCP-style)
‚úÖ Basic API tested and functional 
Added this-
‚úÖ Integration with Hugging Face API for Text Summarization

üõ†Ô∏è What We Plan to Build
REST endpoint /ask-llama or /summarize/:version
Cache layer for LLM results(optional)
Optional IBM Granite/OpenAI-based LLM alternative
Webhook/Slack/Email integration for proactive alerts
History tracking / conversational context
Optional UI frontend (React)
Interactive Speech to Text AI BOT.




Steps:

#Install local llama with model version 3.2 ,

make sure it is running on http://localhost:11434/
 ollama list   

#MCP server 
#go to terraform-mcp/server
#go run main.go 
MCP server is running 9090 and HTTPServer connecting to local Llama is on 8081


for MCP client
go run client/main.g


to geenrate the llama reponse connectd to MCP server
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/ask-llama \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "what is ther in Terraform  Version: v202405-1"}'




=======================================================
response on client will be
